# Hi there! My name is Ariel Rodriguez Romero

I'm a software engineer based in Philadelphia. I studied Computer Science in the University of Havana.

I work as a front end developer at the [Childhood Cancer Data Lab](https://www.ccdatalab.org/). Most of the work we do is open source and can be seen on github.

Before that, I co-founded an ad-tech company named [Bidwise](https://www.bidwise.com/). 
With no outside funding, we made more than one million dollars in revenue in the first year. Bidwise was selected as 
one of the [top 100 startups in North America](https://www.redherring.com/2017-rhna-winners/). There's [a piece](http://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/finanzas/article170516562.html) in El Nuevo Herald about it (in spanish).

My full CV can be seen on [LinkedIn]({{ site.social.linkedin }}).
